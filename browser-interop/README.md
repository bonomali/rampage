# rampage_browser_interop
Dart and JavaScript interoperability for web browser APIs.

## Overview
`rampage_browser_interop` is a translation of web browser APIs into `package:js`
interoperability classes. It is not meant to wrap all browser APIs just those
relevant for `rampage`. It does not provide a friendlier API over the
browser APIs, like `dart:html` does, instead it is a one to one mapping of the
APIs into Dart. A friendlier API is provided by `rampage_html` which is meant
more as a `dart:html` replacement.

The focus of `rampage_browser_interop` is modern browser APIs. If there is a
more modern browser API available that will be wrapped while the legacy one will
not be provided. This is to simplify the interoperability classes and push
developers to use more modern and efficient browser constructs.

## Future Work
Currently all the Dart interoperability classes are all hand made. Browser APIs
are defined in [WebIDL](https://heycam.github.io/webidl) so in the future it
would be ideal to use those definitions to generate Dart code.
